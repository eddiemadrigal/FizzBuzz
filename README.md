# Python FizzBuzz Tutorial

## Overview
This repository contains a simple yet illustrative Python program that implements the classic FizzBuzz problem. It's designed to help beginners understand basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and modulus operations in Python.

## What is FizzBuzz?
FizzBuzz is a common programming problem used in interviews and coding exercises. The task is to print numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

## Why FizzBuzz?
- **Educational Value:** It's a great way to practice basic programming constructs.
- **Interview Prep:** Often used in coding interviews to assess fundamental programming skills.
- **Simplicity:** Simple enough for beginners, yet interesting for experienced programmers.
